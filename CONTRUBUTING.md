Thank you for your interest in contributing to `docs-ecosystem`!

## Pull Requests

The Drivers & Connectors Documentation team uses GitHub to manage and review all changes.

Before starting to write anything, look for [existing tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/DOCS/issues/) or [create one](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) for your bug, issue, or content request.
This helps our team avoid working on something that might not be of interest or something that has already been addressed.

To contribute to this documentation directly, please open a Pull Request against the `master` branch of `docs-ecosystem` and fill out the fields in the template.
Once you have created a pull request, **do not automatically merge**. Please notify a team member of the PR and someone will either review or take over the PR and manage it internally.
